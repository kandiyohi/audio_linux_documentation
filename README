Installed Gentoo.

Had a bunch of problems I couldn't document.  Mostly, I enabled all USB midi
drivers, all audio drivers, and added the nouveau driver.

The realtime kernel failed, but I don't think I need a fully-preemptible kernel
for audio.

I'll duplicate some of the problems and solutions from the Artix install.

-----

Problem: Jack unknown driver "alsa".

Solution: Compile jack-audio-connection-kit with USE="alsa".

Notes: I disabled alsa in general except for applications that needed it.  Just
so it's easier to use other things.  Using the seq driver for jack helps midi
get where it needs to be.

Problem: Fonts are really tiny at 1920x1080,

Possible solution: Increase xterm, qjackctl, and firefox fonts.

Notes: Scaling through xrandr is subpar.

-----

Problem: XTerm fonts are too tiny by default.

Solution: Add this as a line to ~/.Xresources and read the file using xrdb in
.xinitrc: "*VT100.font:   10x20".

Solution2: Add this, too, to ~/.Xresources:

	*VT100.utf8Fonts.font:   10x20

-----

Problem: Xterm doesn't reverse video by default.

Solution: Add this line to ~/.Xresources and ensure xrdb reads at xinit:

	XTerm.VT100.reverseVideo: true

-----

Problem: rust doesn't know for_each exists on Iterator.

Possible solution: `emerge rust`.

-----

Problem: Ardour 5.12 crashes with an assertion failure.

Notes: Assertion failure from the console:

	ardour-5.12.0: /var/tmp/portage/media-sound/jack-audio-connection-kit-0.121.3-r1/work/jack-audio-connection-kit-0.121.3/libjack/midiport.c:310: jack_midi_port_mixdown: Assertion `out_info->event_count == num_events - out_info->events_lost' failed.
	Aborted

Possible solution: Patch the source to Ardour in a custom ebuild repository.
Send the patch to gentoo maintainer.

Actual solution: Modify jack-audio-connection-kit ebuild to add -DNDEBUG flag
to disable asserts (all of them, but we were concerned with the one above from
libjack).
