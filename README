Installed Artix.

Problem: qmidiroute was crashing whenever it probably couldn't update its GUI.

Solution: Use a window manager that allows windows to update themselves at all
times.  Awesome seems to do the job, but Ardour seems to zombify itself if it
isn't on the same tag.

-----

Problem: Can't process quickly.

Possible solution: Compile a realtime OS kernel using the package in the AUR.

-----

Problem: Ethernet is name really weird; "enp0s31f6".

Possible solution: Figure out udev renaming.  Would like to rename to eth0.

-----

Problem: Novation Circuit and Lunachkey 49 appear as audio devices and are
listed first over the alsa device.

Workaround: Ensure those devices are unplugged at boot.

Possible solution: Set audio device or figure out how to renumber them.

-----

Problem: Too many windows.

Possible solution: Better window manager.

-----

Problem: Contorl keys meant to toggle on the Launchkey 49 don't toggle.

Possible solution: Write a state-aware midirouter in the vein of qmidiroute.
